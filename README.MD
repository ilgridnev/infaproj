# BLACK BOX 
Our game is a simulation of electrical circuits for students.

We have a power supplies, resistors, wires, voltmeter and a black box.

You can make different circuits, instructions are given on the interface‚Ä§

Your aim is with building different circuits, by analyzing the relationship between voltage and resistance understand what is in the box and measure the parameters of the contents.




In project we used libraries such as

- Standart library
- numpy
- math
- networkx




## How to run our program

Download the program to your computer
