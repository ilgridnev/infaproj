# BLACK BOX 
Our game is a simulation for students.

We have a power supplies, resistors,wires, one voltmeter and a black box(resistor,which resistance we need to find)

You can make different circuits,instructions are given on the interface‚Ä§

Your aim is with building different circuits,by analyzing the relationship between voltage and resistance get the value of the resistance of this box.




In project we used libraries such as

- Standart library
- numpy
- math
- networkx
- calculation



## How to run our program

Download the program to your computer
